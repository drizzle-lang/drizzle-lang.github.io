# Syntax
Drizzle's source code can can be written in anything up to Unicode, due to Crystal's ability to handle Unicode codepoints in it's `char` type.

The language is currently in an initial design phase, so all the docs in this section are subject to change at will until the implementation begins.

## Example
Here is a brief example of the Drizzle code as it is currently planned to look.

If any specifics change in this section that affect this example, the example will also be updated.
```drizzle
# Also allows double quote strings

# Function definitions
# `num` is a type alias that allows both int and float types to be used
def add(a: num, b: num) -> num {
    return a + b
}

# Fibonacci function
def fibonacci(x: int) -> int {
    if (x == 0) {
        return 0
    }
    elsif (x == 1) {
        return 1
    }
    else {
        return fibonacci(x - 1) + fibonacci(x - 2)
    }
}

# Drizzle supports higher order functions, i.e. functions that take other functions as parameters
def run_twice(f: ((num) -> num), x: num) -> num {
    return f(f(x))
}

def add_two(x: num) {
    return x + 2
}

println(run_twice(add_two, 2)))  # Should print '6'

```
